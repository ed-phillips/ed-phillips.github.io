I am a DPhil candidate at the University of Oxford, researching Clinical AI ('AI for Healthcare') in the Computational Health Informatics Lab. I have industry experience as a data scientist and systems engineer, working in generative AI, medical device development, and biomarker research. I hold a Master's Degree in Information and Computer Engineering from the University of Cambridge, achieving First Class with Distinction.

My research is centered around the development of AI tools to improve clinical decision-making, with an emphasis on explainable and uncertainty-propagating methods.

Other interests include:

- Foundational models for electronic health record data
- Large multimodal models for oncology
- Probabilistic risk prediction
- Uncertainty propagation in large language models
